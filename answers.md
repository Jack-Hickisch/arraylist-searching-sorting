i. okay
ii. okay
iii. Most of the time the BinarySearch was faster at finding an object compared to Search. BinarySearch was always faster at detirmining if the object was not present.

2) An efficient algorithim is one that takes less time and resoruces compared to another option most of the time. The BinarySearch is more effiecient than Search. This is because there is a reason for the items that the BinarySearch checks while the the Search "wanders aimlessly."

i. Search would check each fruit in the list and them detirmine that "blueberry" does not exist. BinarySearch would look at "lime" then go to the 1st half and look at "banana" and then go to th 2nd quarter and look at ["cherry" if you round down or "lemon" if you round up] and then look at "cherry" (if if looked at lemon before) and then detirmine that blueberry does not exist.
ii. Search --> 11; BinarySearch --> 3 to 4 depending
iii. Search --> 1000; BinarySearch --> around 9 depending
